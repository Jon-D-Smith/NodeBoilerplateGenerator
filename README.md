# NodeBoilerplateGenerator


This program will setup a basic boilerplate directory containing an index.html (pre-linked to your app.js and styles.css), app.js, and styles.css. To use this program, clone this to an easy to access location on your system, then run the program from the directory you wish to hold your new project files.

Example:

>First clone the project

C:/JohnSmith/Desktop/ git clone https://github.com/Jon-D-Smith/NodeBoilerplateGenerator.git

>Then choose the directory you wish to create your new project on. I will continue to use my Desktop directory in this example.

C:/JohnSmith/Desktop/ node ./NodeBoilerplateGenerator/boilerplate.js ProjectName

> Please note, the "ProjectName" will need to be replaced by the actual name of your project. If this is left out, it will default to "Project"

C:/JohnSmith/Desktop/ cd ProjectName

C:/JohnSmith/Desktop/ProjectName ls
//     app.js index.html styles.css


>Once this is done, feel free to run index.html, or start coding right off the bat
